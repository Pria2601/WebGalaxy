## Model UI
### Overview
This AI-powered tool enables the automated generation and enhancement of website templates using Google Gemini models. By analyzing user input, it intelligently modifies HTML, CSS, and images to produce optimized, modern web designs.

### Features
- AI-driven template selection and customization.
- Google Gemini API integration for content extraction and transformation.
- Automated HTML structure improvements.
- Dynamic color palette generation based on themes.
- Intelligent image selection via Unsplash API.
- Regeneration of existing templates using alternative matches.

### Installation
#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed
Set up the environment variables by creating a .env file or using product_development.env.
Set up Pipenv and install dependencies by running:
  pipenv shell
To generate a fresh requirements.txt file from an existing environment:
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file or use `product_development.env`:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY_1=your_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY_2=your_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY_3=your_key_here
UNSPLASH_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
Load variables in Python:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv("product_development.env")
```

### How to Start Website Generation (this is where the model runs)
#### 1. 
To generate a website based on user input, run:
```bash
python website_generator_model.py
```
Then, enter the prompt specifying the website you want to generate. The generated website will be stored in the generated folder.
#### 2. Website Regeneration
For regenerating templates with an alternative match:
```bash
python update_regenerate.py
```
Here, the user will enter the prompt either to regenerate the whole website or update specific sections based on the prompt. The updated website will be saved in the generated folder, where the user can run and check the modifications.
